PROJECT GAME: Rock, Paper, Scissors
The game can play for one round and is working with no errors. 

Player is asked to enter 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors' through prompt message.

The player's input can be in capital, lower case letters, or combination.
The player's input is converted into the following format:
 - first letter is capital, and
 - the rest of the word is lowercase

If the player's input is not one of the acceptable options of the game,
error message is displayed into console.

UPDATE: 

Updated the game to play 5 rounds.
Player is prompted to enter 'Rock', 'Paper', or 'Scissors' each round.
Added console message to display what round is played (i.e., 'Round 1', etc.).
When a round is over, a winner of the round is announced via console and the total score is updated to show score for the player and the computer.

When the game is over the winner is announced based on the total score.
In case of a tie an appropriate message is displayed.
